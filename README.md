To be able to successfully run this repo locally you will need to create two environment variables. These are not stored on github for security reasons and therefore will be missing when the repo is git cloned to your machine. The two files you will need to create are 
.env.test and .env.development. In these files you will need to set the PGDATABASE to the corresponding database name. Please see the 
.env-example file for an example of this.

The .gitignore file is already set to ignore all the .env files so these new environment variables will not be pushed up to github.
